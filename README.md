# Welcome To Stream Queue!

This is my submission for Flatiron School's phase 3 curriculum on Ruby on Rails. 
<br>
This application was built using Ruby On Rails and uses Sqlite as a database.

## About 
Have you ever wanted to have all the shows or movies, you've been wanting to checkout, across all streaming platforms, in one place? Have you ever spent more time lookng for something to watch with your partner, family, or group of friends, rather than actually watching something? Well then Stream Queue is for you. Create a profile, and start keeping track of which shows and movies you want to watch across all your different streaming platforms. 

## Run 

Fork and clone this repository.
<br>
run `bundle install` in your terminal
<br>
next, enter `rails s` to start the local host
<br>
create a user profile, login, and start filling up your queue!
